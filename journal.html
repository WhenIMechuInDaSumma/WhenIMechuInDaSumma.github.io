	<h2>October 1st, 2024:</h2>

		This is my first journal entry in cs1. As of right now I have just started my website. All that's there is a sun that's trying to set and some clouds. I've also had a problem creating my github account, so I can't get my website online. NewLabs is working on fixing it right now, so I hope I can make my website public soon. My plan for my website is a sun that sets when clicked, bringing a moon and making it nightime. Clouds will also part and stars will come in. I wanted to have my projects links during the daytime and my journal in the nightime, but I haven't fully figured everything out yet. Im excited for the year in cs1.
