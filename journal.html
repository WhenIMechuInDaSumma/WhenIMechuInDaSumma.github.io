	<h2>October 1st, 2024:</h2>

		This is my first journal entry in cs1. As of right now I have just started my website. All that's there is a sun that's trying to set and some clouds. I've also had a problem creating my github account, so I can't get my website online. NewLabs is working on fixing it right now, so I hope I can make my website public soon. My plan for my website is a sun that sets when clicked, bringing a moon and making it nightime. Clouds will also part and stars will come in. I wanted to have my projects links during the daytime and my journal in the nightime, but I haven't fully figured everything out yet. Im excited for the year in cs1.

		Today we made our first animation called animation.html. We used @keyframes to add steps to our animations that told a div where to go 25% percent in or 50% in and so on. This was just a simple introduction and not a true project, but using animations I can make my website much better.

		Today I worked on making a gift for my slime Sidney. I took some sneaky photots of him on photo booth in class, and then used the new javascript functions we learned to make a cool clock. Basically, a function runs every second creating a new div under a certain class. I styled that class, but also added a counter that counts up by 1 every second. So after naming all of my images x.jpeg, I could set the background image on every new div created to "+counter+ .jpeg". This makes the photos change every new div that pops up. My gift isn't done yet though, I'm planning to make the divs spell something out as well.

		<h2>November 30th, 2024:</h2>

		Today I made a jumpscare for our new project. I coded a ball moving through a tight passage that you neededd to follow with your mouse. You get super focused on following it with your mouse and then a photo of pennywise jumps out at you. The way I made it was using positionings and animations. I made an animation where each step sent the ball to a different position, and then outlined the movement with green boxes in the pathway and turned the background red.

		<h2>December 15th, 2024:</h2>

		Today I started work on a solo project called game.html. This wasn't something we all worked on in class but I felt like making a game. Its kind of like space invaders where there are a bunch of bricks at the top and a moveable shooter at the bottom. Right now all I have is the bricks spelling hello and a moveable shooter div that doesnt't shoot arrows. I made it move using an event listener for the left and right arrow keys that added or subtracted 10px to the divs positioning. I'll continue working on this later and probably in lab.

		<h2>January 17th, 2025:</h2>

		Today I continued working on my slot machine called gambling.html. I need to maximize the amount of gambling opportunities on my website. We used arrays and random number generators to arrange the different images randomly in the slot machine after clicking a button. I used a 7, bar, diamond, fig, and coin as my divs. We created a scoreboard and alerts when you got 2 or 3 of the same.
